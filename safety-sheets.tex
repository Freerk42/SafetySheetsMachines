This machine contains commercial software which is locked to this specific hardware and OS install. Neither of which we can re-install (as we have no media and the suppliers have long gone out of business). So be very very careful with USB sticks and other media. A virus or malware may permanently kill this setup.

Only switch XYZ feeds when the machine is not running. Use the handwheel to get the gear fully locked in prior to starting the feed. Be sure to tighten all 4 nuts post rotating the head or all 4 nuts when moving the head laterally.

Try to avoid getting coolant or similar on the slide-ways - especially the Y slipway between machine and table. Use a shield or adjust the flow. Machine needs to be cleaned post use.  When using coolant - also empty the recess on the left of the table and clean out the t-Slots until dry.
